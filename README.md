# Private Equity firms are buying up cancer clinics.

## Data Sources

The idea for this article came from this study in JAMA Internal Medicine. I replicated a part of their data collection method by using CB Insights. 

These were my search parameters:

- Advanced Search, Companies Search
  Keywords (“Oncology”)
  Industry (“Healthcare,” “Medical Facilities & Services”)
  Company Attributes, Keyword (“Oncology”)
  Geography (“United States”)
  No Financing & Exit specifications selected
  No date range selected

This yielded 135 oncology companies. 

I also scraped pestakeholder.org for their records of oncology clinic acquisitions from October 2020 to August 2023.

I also referenced data from Community Oncology Alliance's (COA) impact reports on consolidation in community oncology clinics.
