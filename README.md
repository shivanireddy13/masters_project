# Private Equity firms are buying up oncology clinics. Is that good for U.S. healthcare?

## Data Sources

The idea for this article came from [this study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804123) in JAMA Internal Medicine. I replicated a part of their data collection method by using CB Insights. 

These were my search parameters:

- Advanced Search, Companies Search
- Keywords (“Oncology”)
- Industry (“Healthcare,” “Medical Facilities & Services”)
- Company Attributes, Keyword (“Oncology”)
- No Geography (“United States”)
- No Financing & Exit specifications selected
- No date range selected

This yielded 135 oncology companies. 

I also scraped pestakeholder.org for their records of oncology clinic acquisitions from October 2020 to August 2023.

I also referenced data from Community Oncology Alliance's (COA) impact reports on consolidation in community oncology clinics.
